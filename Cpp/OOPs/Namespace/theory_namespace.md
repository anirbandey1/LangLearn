# Namespace

Namespace extension refers to the process of adding new declarations to an existing namespace. This is useful when you want to add new functionality to a library or module without modifying its original source code.

The second namespace block does not have a **using namespace** statement, so all the names defined within it are automatically added to the existing mylib namespace. This allows us to add new functionality to the namespace without having to modify the original code.
